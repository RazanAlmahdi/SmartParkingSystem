# SmartParkingSystem

# Concept
The project, titled as the "Smart Parking System." aims to develop an advanced embedded system that utilizes Arduino microcontrollers
and sensors to provide an intelligent parking solution with integrated fire detection and prevention capabilities.

 # Hardware Components
 
 The hardware components used in this project are as follows:
 
 - 1 breadboard
 - 1 smoke/gas sensor
 - 2 ultrasonic distance sensors
 - 1 Push button
 - 1 potentiometer
 - 1 Piezo
 - LCD display screen

 # The circuit (Virtual)

 The virtual circuit has been designed on the Tinkercad platform. The circuit is accessable via the followin link:

```

 This is how the circuit looks and functions:
 
 - Parking Slot Display:

The circuit displays a welcome message to the user, followed by the number of available parking slots. 
Once a parking slot is occupied or taken by a vehicle, the message on screen will change, displaying the new number of available slots.
Likewise, if a car evacuates a parking spot, it will be declared free on the screen.

- Fire/Gas Detection Display:

The gas/smoke sensor is highly sensitive to gas, temperature and smoke. Thus, once an abnormal temperature or smoke is detected, the buzzer will go off. A warning message will be displayed on screen, directing the user to follow the emergency exits and provides the emergency contact number.
