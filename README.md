# SmartParkingSystem

# Concept
 In recent years, the rapid growth of urbanization and the increasing number of
 vehicles on the road have led to a significant challenge in finding available parking
 spaces efficiently. Traditional parking systems often result in time-consuming and
 frustrating experiences for drivers, causing congestion and unnecessary fuel
 consumption. Additionally, the ever-present risk of fire accidents in parking areas further
 highlights the need for enhanced safety measures.
 To address these challenges, we present our project, the "Smart Parking System."
 Our aim is to develop an advanced embedded system that utilizes Arduino
 microcontrollers and sensors to provide an intelligent parking solution with integrated
 fire detection and prevention capabilities.
